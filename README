Welcome to the Janrain Engage library for the Android platform.  This library is available
open-source under a Berkeley license, as found in the LICENSE file.

What's new in 2.0:

- Tablet support
  - Authentication runs in a dialog
  - Sharing runs either as an embedded Fragment or in a dialog
  - support for Theme.Holo, including appropriate themes for xlarge screens
- bug fixes
  - no more NPEs from JRConnectionManager
  - user messages are now propagated to email/SMS intents the first time the button is pressed
  - switched from URLConnection to HttpClient to avoid socket timeout bugs
- must now be compiled against Android 11/Honeycomb/3.0 but still deployable to Android 4+ (Donut/1.6)
- no longer compatible with Android 3 (Cupcake/1.5)
