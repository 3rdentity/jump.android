Welcome to the Janrain Engage library for the Android platform.  This library is available
open-source under a Berkeley license, as found in the LICENSE file.

What's new in 2.0:

- Tablet support
  - Authentication runs in a dialog
  - Sharing runs either as an embedded Fragment or in a dialog
  - Support for Theme.Holo.Light, including appropriate themes for xlarge screens
- Bug fixes
  - No more NPEs from JRConnectionManager
  - User messages are now propagated to email/SMS intents the first time the button is pressed
  - Switched from URLConnection to HttpClient to avoid some platform bugs.
- JRConnectionManager's networking layer now supports gzip compression for faster network operations.
- Must now be compiled against Android 13 / Honeycomb 3.2 but still deployable to Android 4+ (Donut / 1.6)
- No longer compatible with Android 3 (Cupcake / 1.5)

Updating from 1.x to 2.0:

- Replace the activity declarations in your AndroidManifest.xml with fresh copies from
  JREngage/AndroidManifest.xml
- Ensure that the JREngage/libs/android-support-v4.jar is added to your project
- Ensure that the jackson-core-lgpl-1.6.4.jar and jackson-mapper-lgpl-1.6.4.jar libraries are removed from
  your project.
